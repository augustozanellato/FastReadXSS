      This page is a proof of concept for an xss in <a href="https://github.com/ahrm/chrome-fastread">chrome-fastread</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/akay/firefox-fastread">firefox-fastread</a>. There is zero user interaction required
      apart from the user enabling FastRead. The vulnerability enables an attacker to have stored XSS on every site that 
      allows attacker-controlled text, for example comments on a blog or sth like that.
